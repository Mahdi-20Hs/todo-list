# todo-list

## Overview:
This is a to-do list project from TOP curriculum, In this app you can create different tasks with different dates, descriptions, notes and also differnt priority degrees, the app alows you to check, uncheck and delete any task you want, you can also create multiple projects and then create your tasks within these projects.

The project focuses on the proper use of modules and OOP principles specifically the single responsibility principle. Initially I struggled with how should I structure my modules and how can I implement the single responsiblity principle but eventually after trying and experimenting a lot I did get some kind of understanding of how should this work and how this principle makes building your project so clear and structured and also makes it even easier to modify and change your different modules in a way that does not effect the other components.

## What I learned:
- how to trigger an event for one time only.
- how to do event delegation.
- how to rotate image using CSS.
- how to call a function on page load.
- how to undo changes using Git.
